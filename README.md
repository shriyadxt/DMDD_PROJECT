# Customer Complaints Management System
# Problem Statement
The purpose of this database is to maintain customer complaints and hold the issues about products, accounts, payments and other services for a particular warranty period. Through this customer retention can be achieved by resolving the case within the stipulated time and helping them track the status of their case.  

Customer service is an important aspect of any Business. Customer loyalty can be lost as a result of poor customer service, which can lead to negative reviews and numerous customers advising their families and friends not to use the company. As a result, client happiness determines the company's growth or decline, and the company can only grow if we work towards retaining and extracting more value from them. 

# Objective
Employees should be able to register all customer information into the case. Details of all hardware replacements should be stored in a database to predict resolution time and cost. Customer data provided by customer service is used to compute the cost, which is based on warranty information. Customer retention is likely if replacements/fixes are completed within the predicted time of resolution.
